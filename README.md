# Hey there! 👋 I'm Aïssa.

## About Me 🚀

I'm a Fullstack Web Developer with a knack for coding and a background in e-business.
Currently diving into the world of Business Analysis for my Master's degree, but my heart belongs to coding.
Dreaming of becoming a Software Engineer and planning to stack up those degrees in Computer Science and Software Engineering along the way!

## Experience 💼

I've been the **one-man** army behind some cool projects, like **building an internal platform for a small business to manage consultant objectives efficiently**.
From brainstorming to deployment, to 🧠 **LLM integration** 🧠, I've done it all!
Many thanks to the YouTube community and, *above everything*, **David J. Malan**, the famous professor teaching the world's greatest Computer Science course, namely **CS50 from Harvard's University**! 🎓

## Skills and Specializations 💻

- Backend: ✅ **Python** (Django), a little bit of C (Thanks Harvard)
- Frontend: ⏳ **ReactJS** (Next.JS), ⏳ Svelte (SvelteKit)
- Database: ✅ **PostgreSQL**
- Tools: ✅ Figma, ✅ **Docker Compose**, 🔜 AWS EC2, cron job (used one time...)
- Testing: ✅ Hundreds of unit tests using the unittest Python module, Integration tests with Selenium
- Future Aspirations: Eyeing Machine Learning through *DeepLearning.ai* 🤖

## Projects 🛠️

Right now, I'm cooking up a SaaS project, expanding on something I did in a previous project. Using SvelteKit or Next.JS to spice up the UX/UI!

## Goals 🎯

I'm on a mission to master web and mobile app development and sprinkle some Machine Learning magic into the mix. After my 8 to 4, I'm dedicating my evenings to leveling up my skills!

## Personal Interests 🌟

- I'm low-key obsessed with Elon Musk and his mind-bending ideas.
- My knack for Business Analysis gives me a unique edge in product development.
- Oh, and I'm deeply in love with my wife, L. ❤

## Philosophy 📚

I truly believe **curiosity** and **discipline** are the secret sauce for success. Teach your kids those, and the world's their oyster!

## Let's Connect! 🤝

Hit me up for chats, collabs, or just to geek out about tech! I'm all ears and always up for making new connections.
